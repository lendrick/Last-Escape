III. BACKGROUND STORY
================================================================================

Fifty years after humanity has discovered the hyperspace technology, thus
enabling the colonization of the galaxy, the Interstellar Mining Corporation
sends a scout team to the lately discovered OGA-1138 solar system located in the 
BART-1337 sector. You are one of the mercenaries hired to defend and escort the
expedition. But, due to an energy leak, your transport starship crashes on the
planet's surface. To survive you have to find enough energy sources to refill
your ship's energy cells. But it seems you and your team are not the only ones
wandering through the ruins of an ancient race...
